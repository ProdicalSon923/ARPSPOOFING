# ARPSPOOFING
Hands-on cybersecurity lab demonstrating network configuration, ARP analysis, and ARP spoofing (MITM) between Kali Linux and Windows virtual machines using VMware.




This repository documents a hands-on cybersecurity lab where a Kali Linux VM and a Windows VM were configured on the same virtual network using VMware. The goal of the lab was to understand how devices communicate at Layer 2, how ARP works, and how ARP spoofing enables man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks in a controlled environment.
